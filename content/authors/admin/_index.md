Currently, I am a PhD candidate in Sociology at Stanford University. My research spans a wide array of topics - education, environmental justice, neighborhood change, political infrastructure, and crime - but the overarching motivation behind my projects is a passion for using geospatial data to address applied geographic and geospatial problems from drawing borders and boundaries to facility siting to resource allocation.
